/**
 * Golf-course data plausibility validator — `npm run validate:courses`.
 *
 * Born from a real incident: Artitaya Country Club shipped with a ฿400
 * weekday green fee — a scraped Thai-national/promo rate presented as the
 * standard visitor rate. Fees are the single most-read fact on the 149
 * course pages (hero, sidebar, FAQ, JSON-LD offers), so implausible values
 * must not ship silently.
 *
 * ERROR (exit 1):
 *  - weekday or weekend green fee below the absolute floor (฿150) or absurd
 *    ceiling (฿20,000)
 *  - weekend fee LOWER than weekday (does not happen in the Thai market;
 *    flat rates are fine)
 *  - suspicious-pattern fees (see WARN rules) on a course with NO
 *    `fees_verified_at` attestation — unverified suspicious data fails CI
 *  - malformed `fees_verified_at` (not YYYY-MM-DD)
 *  - REGION_META.courseCount disagreeing with the region's index.ts slugs
 *    (what actually renders), or an index slug with no file / a file with
 *    no index slug. courseCount is hand-maintained and now selects an ICU
 *    plural branch as well as printing a number — see checkRegionCounts
 *
 * WARN (non-blocking) when `fees_verified_at` IS present:
 *  - weekday fee under ฿600 (genuinely possible: EGAT dam courses, army
 *    9-holers — but every one must be human-verified)
 *  - weekend more than 2.2× weekday
 *  - `fees_verified_at` older than 18 months (rates drift; re-check)
 *
 * Coordinates, after a course page shipped a satellite pin several km from
 * the course:
 *  - ERROR: coordinates outside Thailand's bounding box, only one of
 *    lat/lng set, or a malformed `coordinates_verified_at`
 *  - WARN: rounded to <3 decimal places (~1.1 km — a district centroid).
 *    Only a warning because `hasTrustedCoordinates` (lib/geo.ts) already
 *    withholds those from the map pin and from schema GeoCoordinates, so the
 *    bad number never reaches a reader; it stays usable for proximity
 *    ranking. Clear the debt with `npm run verify:coordinates`.
 *
 * No server needed. Zero deps beyond tsx.

 * REGION_META.courseCount vs what the region hub actually renders.
 *
 * courseCount is hand-maintained and drives real output: the hub's meta
 * description, its hero card, the OG card chip — and, since the count/noun
 * work, WHICH ICU PLURAL BRANCH renders. A stale count no longer just prints
 * a wrong number; it commits the sentence to the wrong grammatical form
 * ("Our guide to 1 golf course in Krabi" above two cards).
 *
 * THREE sources of truth exist and they must agree:
 *   1. REGION_META.courseCount  — the advertised number.
 *   2. data/golf-courses/<region>/index.ts `slugs` — what
 *      getCoursesByRegion() maps over, i.e. what actually RENDERS as cards
 *      and what generateStaticParams builds. Note it does NOT filter by
 *      `status`, so a draft still renders.
 *   3. The .ts files on disk — what a course author edits.
 * Checking (1) against (3) alone is not enough: a re-region that moves the
 * file and updates courseCount but forgets index.ts leaves 1 and 3 agreeing
 * while the hub renders a different number of cards. That is precisely the
 * shape of the kumlung-ake move in this PR, where both index.ts files had to
 * be hand-edited. So compare 1↔2 (the user-visible claim) and 2↔3 (orphans).
 *
 * Parsed out of the source text rather than imported: lib/golf-courses.ts is
 * `import 'server-only'` and throws under plain tsx (same constraint that
 * forced the hardcoded list in the smoke test).

 * caddie & cart)" is true and is the most useful sentence on the page. A blanket
 * "no green-fee term on a package course" rule would fire on all ten of those
 * and get switched off. The title is different: it labels the page's price with
 * a bare noun and no room for a qualifier.
 *
 * Both package courses shipped all five titles with the noun — the ko one read
 * `그린피` and `올인클루시브` in the same string — while the fee FAQ and the meta
 * fee line were correctly suppressed. That is the "enumerated field-by-field or
 * not at all" failure, on the single most prominent field: the title is also the
 * openGraph title and the internal cross-link anchor text via lib/seo-links.
 *
 * Checks the RENDERED title (`getCourseTitle`), not the stored one, because EN
 * comes from a generator and the non-EN blocks are returned verbatim.
