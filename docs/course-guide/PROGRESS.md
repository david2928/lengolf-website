Wangjuntr was held in the Bangkok pipeline for region mismatch — it is in Wang Chan, Rayong. Bangpra fee structure provisional: multiple booking platforms show different rates; pattayagolf.net (1,700/2,500 THB) used as primary.

3. Read `docs/course-guide/reports/pattaya-batch.report.md`
4. Approve: `"Approve Pattaya batch"` (with any dispute resolutions)
5. Claude runs Stage 5 publish script and updates the region `index.ts`
6. Add the region to `REGIONS` and `REGION_META` in `lib/golf-courses.ts`
7. Move the region from `COMING_SOON_REGIONS` → `PUBLISHED_REGIONS` in `app/[locale]/golf-courses/page.tsx`, and add it to `hubRegions`
8. Add 2–3 smoke test routes for the new region in `scripts/smoke-test.ts`
