    "storyParagraph1": "Our story began as a group of golf-loving expats in Bangkok who just wanted to play golf. But we often found that traffic and weather got in the way. Frustrated, we sought out golf simulators as a convenient alternative. While the technology was impressive, the private room and closed off nature of the available options in Bangkok left much to be desired. We envisioned a place that combined the excitement of golf with a lively, social atmosphere.",
    "storyParagraph2": "Determined to create something unique, we decided to take matters into our own hands. We tore down the walls, added a bar, and infused the space with a welcoming, relaxed vibe. The result is {name}, a haven for golf enthusiasts of all skill levels. Located at the Chidlom BTS stop, we offer state-of-the-art Korean simulators, delicious food and drinks, and a break from the Bangkok heat. At {name}, we're more than just a golf simulator; we're a community where fun and golf thrive.",
