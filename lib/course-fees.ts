/**
 * `green_fee_weekday_thb` / `green_fee_weekend_thb` hold the LOWER and HIGHER of a
 * course's two published rates. What SPLITS them differs by course: most price by
 * day of week, but a course with `fee_is_seasonal` prices by SEASON (low/high) and
 * has no weekday/weekend distinction at all.
 *
 * Every surface that puts a LABEL on those numbers — or derives a day-of-week
 * claim from them — must route through this module. Labelling a seasonal course's
 * rates "weekday/weekend" asserts a split that does not exist, and most of these
 * surfaces are statically generated and indexed (course detail, compare, best-for,
 * price-tier roundups, region map).
 *
 * Numeric-only consumers do NOT need this — popularity scoring, price-tier
 * bucketing and sorting never show the reader a basis. `lib/golf-courses-derived.ts`
 * and the tier lookup in the course-detail route are deliberately untouched.
 *
 * When adding a seasonal course, grep `green_fee_weekday_thb` across the repo
 * (including `data/`, which is easy to scope out of a search and is where
 * `golf-courses-use-cases.ts` lives). TypeScript cannot find label sites for you:
 * these are plain string templates, so a missed one compiles and ships.

 * weekday/weekend LABELS are correct and must keep rendering — but both numbers
 * are all-in packages including caddie and shared cart, so calling either a

 * they are right — SpecTable, /near/, /compare/, /under/<tier>/,
 * golf-courses-use-cases, the region map, AND (missing from the first count,
 * which is the same one-site-short shape this predicate exists to prevent)
 * `CoursePage`'s own fee-card rows and `enOfferNames` in jsonld-courses.
 *
 * Used only by the two generated-copy gates in `lib/course-seo.ts` (the fee FAQ,
 * which also ships as FAQPage structured data, and the meta description's fee
 * line). Both SUPPRESS rather than relabel, which is the same thing they already
 * do for `fee_is_seasonal` — the course's own prose states the price and what it

 *   gets told its all-in rate is a green fee — `validate:fee-labels`' noun rule
 *   exists to catch exactly that, and will flag it.
 * - `upperInline` — the hero chip's inline "{price} THB" line for the upper rate.
 * - `upperShort` — the abbreviated tag the region-hub roster puts after the upper
 *   rate, where the non-seasonal form is `wknd` rather than `weekend`.
 *
 * Returning the whole set (rather than one pair) is deliberate: the catalogs use

/**
 * Localized NOUN PHRASE pair for a course's two rates, e.g.
 * `{ lower: '平日グリーンフィー', upper: '週末グリーンフィー' }` — or, for a
 * package course, `{ lower: '平日パッケージ', upper: '週末パッケージ' }`.
 *
 * Two separate reasons this is centralized, and both were learned the hard way:
 *
 * 1. LOCALE. The schema.org `Offer.name` on a course-detail page and the
 *    `Offer.description` on a price-tier roundup were built from `feeLabelsEn`,
 *    which this module reserves for the EN-pinned routes — so every localized
 *    page shipped an English label inside `lang="ja"` structured data.
 * 2. NOUN. `feeLabelKeys` splits the BASIS (weekday/weekend vs low/high season);
 *    the `*Heading` keys additionally assert the noun "green fee". Those are two
 *    claims, and a package course splits them: kaeng-krachan really does charge
 *    less on weekdays, so its basis labels are right, but both rates are all-in
 *    packages covering caddie and cart, so "Weekday green fee" tells a reader the
 *    caddie is extra. Suppressing generated copy (`statesABareGreenFee`) fixed
 *    that for the FAQ and the meta line and left this — the hero price card, the
 *    fee panel and `makesOffer[].name` — still saying it, on 10 indexed pages.
 *    That is the exact "fix the cheap string, leave the prominent one" shape
 *    CLAUDE.md records as having taken four rounds for `fee_is_seasonal`.
 *
 * The package form composes `packageHeading` around the BARE basis word rather
 * than adding four more catalog keys, so it works for a seasonal package too
 * without anyone having to remember to write `highSeasonPackage`.
 *
 * `t` is a `GolfCourseDetail` translator (next-intl's `getTranslations`), passed
 * in rather than resolved here so `lib/jsonld-courses.ts` stays sync and
 * next-intl-free. For a non-package course EN composes byte-identically to the
 * pre-existing `` `${feeLabelsEn(c).lower} green fee` `` — `weekdayGreenFee` is
 * already "Weekday green fee" — so this is a no-op for all 147 of them.
