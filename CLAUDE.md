# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LENGOLF website — a Next.js 15 (App Router) site for an indoor golf simulator facility in Bangkok (The Mercury Ville @ BTS Chidlom). Supabase-backed with static/ISR rendering, deployed on Vercel at https://len.golf. Originally migrated from WordPress.

## Commands

- **Dev server:** `npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000)
- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Start production:** `npm run start`
- **Lint:** `npm run lint`
- **Validate internal links:** `npm run validate:links` — checks that SEO cross-links in `data/*.ts` (`related_slugs`, FAQ `related_questions`) resolve to published pages. No server needed.
- **⚠️ NO PR IS "READY" WITHOUT A `pr-rigor` PASS — and an inline `/code-review`
  with zero agents spawned is NOT a review.** Run `.claude/skills/pr-rigor/SKILL.md`
  before telling anyone (especially the user's manager) that a PR is ready, green,
  or mergeable. It spawns 3–6 independent adversarial finders on *distinct* angles
  plus role passes: **claim audit** (every assertion in the PR body, the commit
  messages and any CLAUDE.md text the PR adds, verified against code), **guard
  efficacy** (break each guard's input on purpose, confirm it goes red),
  native-QA per locale, and a release-readiness verdict. Every verdict states
  `Independent review agents spawned: N`; if N is 0 you may not report a verdict.
  This rule existed as an operator convention from PR #36 onward, was named in the
  bodies of #36/#56/#57 and in a #88 **comment** (not #86, which describes the same
  discipline without the name) and **written down nowhere**, which is precisely
  how it got lost. It has now been violated twice with the same signature: PR #88
  disclosed reporting a verdict from a zero-agent self-read, and PR #93 reported
  "no correctness bugs" from a single inline `/code-review` — an outside pass then
  found six confirmed defects — at least four live on indexed pages, one that
  rendered nowhere — with CI fully green. Later rounds found five more.
  **CI cannot read a sentence: every one of those defects had reached `main` with
  `lint`/`build-and-smoke`/`lighthouse` green.** Corollary: *treat any claim in the commit history,
  a PR description, or this file as an assertion, not evidence* — verify it or
  delete it. And never generalize from one fixed instance ("found the missed
  consumer" → "all consumers now honor it"): enumerate repo-wide, don't infer.
- **⚠️ EVERY translation batch needs NATIVE-LANGUAGE QA before it merges — the
  automated gate does not substitute for it.** `validate:i18n` catches mechanical
  violations (emoji, currency form, terminology `avoid` variants, namespace
  parity); it cannot tell you that a sentence means the opposite of the source.
  Native QA has caught a blocker in **six of seven** batches run so far, and none
  of those blockers was mechanically detectable *at the time*:
    - ja `/best`: a conclusion ending `料理教室が抜けています` — "the cooking class
      is MISSING from this list", the inverse of EN's "beats everything else",
      as the last sentence of the page.
    - ko `/best`: `Hyde & Seek이` / `Hyde & Seek과` — wrong particle allomorph
      ("Seek" transcribes to 시크, vowel-final, so both were the consonant-final
      form). A regex CANNOT catch this: the allomorph depends on the Korean
      READING, which Latin text does not carry, so a mechanical "no particle
      after Latin" check flags every correct attachment instead.
    - zh `/best`: a coined `齐隆` for Chidlom while `messages/zh.json` ships
      `奇隆` 5×, so one page rendered two spellings of the same BTS station.
    - ko/zh course details: one blocker plus ~55 fixes.
    - ko `/hotels`: `The Mercury Ville과` in the `walkableFarBody` UI string —
      an allomorphic particle (과) glued to a Latin name with no resolvable
      Korean reading (same class as the `Seek이/과` bug). The mechanical gate
      was green; the native prose read caught it. Fix: insert a Korean noun
      (`The Mercury Ville 건물과`), the pattern the hotel content entries use.
    - th `PRICE_TIER_I18N['3500-baht'].catch`: the slot held a **Simplified
      Chinese paragraph**. A commit claiming a 5-locale rewrite had touched two,
      and put the zh rendering in the `th` field; `/th/golf-courses/under/3500-baht/`
      served Chinese inside Thai chrome, while ja/ko/zh still carried the false
      claim the edit existed to delete. Every gate was green — the string is
      well-formed, emoji-free, brace-balanced, and its terminology is correct
      *for Chinese*. The one mechanical trace was a single non-blocking WARN
      among 388 (a th unit priced in `500泰铢`). This one IS now mechanically
      detectable — see the `checkScript` bullet — but only because it happened.
  **A whole-slot swap is the failure mode to watch when one person edits several
  locales in one pass.** Two independent guards: paste each locale's replacement
  in a separate edit anchored on that locale's OWN current text (never a
  positional edit), and after the batch, census the scripts per slot rather than
  re-reading the diff — a diff shows the new text is *present*, not that it is in
  the *right field*.
  **`/hotels` (48 content entries + 35 UI-chrome strings) shipped in PR #90
  WITHOUT this pass** — an account spend limit killed the reviewers — but has
  **since had its native prose read** (the batch that caught the ko particle
  blocker above, plus a few grounded nits). Debt discharged **for `/hotels`**. Do NOT read that as corpus-wide: no
  ledger records a prose read of `price-guide-pages.ts`, `activity-occasions.ts`,
  `PRICE_TIER_I18N`, `REGION_HUB_I18N` or most of `messages/*.json`. Keep the rule
  anyway — do not let a *future* batch merge on a green gate alone. (The #90
  review pass also added `/hotels` to the `validate:i18n` corpus, where it had
  been absent, so it now gets the mechanical checks too.)
- **⚠️ A claim that is false under EVERY available reading gets DELETED, not deferred to
  the owner.** PR #96 found that `siam-country-club-waterside`'s EN prose says its pricing
  is "premium tier but still **below the Old Course**" while the typed fees are 5,960/6,960
  against the Old Course's 3,550/4,350 — ~68% **higher** — and `lib/course-fees.ts` renders
  both tables on sibling pages of the same region hub. It was found BEFORE merge, written up
  as "known gap #1", and **shipped anyway in five languages**, on the reasoning that only the
  owner could say whether the prose or the fee data was wrong. That reasoning is a trap: it
  frames a false sentence as a binary (fix prose / fix data) and misses the third option that
  is always available — **drop the unsupportable clause**. "Premium tier" was true under
  either reading; the comparative was true under neither. Removing a claim asserts nothing
  new, needs no owner ruling, and is not the same as inventing a correction. Reserve
  "needs the content owner" for claims that are merely *unverifiable*, never for claims you
  have already proven false.
- **LENGOLF service claims must be checked against `messages/en.json` and `data/pricing.ts`,
  which are the authoritative statement of what the business actually offers.** The i18n
  honesty rule was written for *coach-language* claims and `glossary.honesty_constraints`
  only enumerates those, so a native-QA pass can come back "clean on honesty" while a
  different false service promise sails through. Real case (PR #96):
  `laguna-golf-phuket` told renters their clubs were "**fully insured**" — in EN and, after
  the batch, in all four locales — while `messages/en.json` answers *"Do I need to pay a
  deposit or insurance to rent golf clubs?"* with **"No. LENGOLF requires no deposit, no
  insurance"** and warns that damage beyond normal wear may incur a repair fee. A renter
  told the set is insured and then billed for a repair has a real complaint. This was the one
  false EN claim the batch actively multiplied. When any content mentions rental, delivery,
  insurance, deposits, lessons or coaching, grep the FAQ answers in `messages/en.json` and
  `data/pricing.ts` for the same subject before trusting it.
- **A blind fix-apply validates the ANCHOR, not the RESULT.** The review protocol in
  `docs/i18n-review-checklist.md` has reviewers emit exact `Current:` → `Replace with:` pairs
  that the orchestrator applies without re-reading the file. PR #96 applied 193 of these with
  a uniqueness assertion on every anchor — and still shipped a visible stutter, because a th
  reviewer's *replacement* restated a clause that lived **outside** its *anchor*: the anchor
  ended at `ในฐานะ`, the original sentence continued `หนึ่งในผลงานเด่นของเขาในภาคตะวันออก`, and the
  replacement reintroduced that same clause, so the rendered sentence said it twice. A unique,
  byte-exact anchor cannot see what it is landing next to. Two guards: make the anchor span
  through the end of everything the replacement restates, and after a blind batch **re-read
  the changed strings** (or run an n-gram repetition scan over the touched fields) rather than
  trusting the per-edit assertions.
- **Mutation-test guards with DEGENERATE values, not just deletion.** The `course-prose-partial`
  check added in PR #96 was mutation-tested by removing a prose field, went red, and was
  declared proven. It still passed a **whitespace-only** field, because the test used a bare
  truthiness check — and `CoursePage` falls back with `??`, not `||`, so `'   '` *beats* the
  English fallback and renders an empty `<p>` under a localized `<h2>` while hreflang
  advertises a full translation. Deleting a field proves the guard sees absence; it says
  nothing about near-misses. Every new detector needs a mutation set of at least: absent,
  empty string, whitespace-only, and wrong-type/null.
- **When you fix a renderer, enumerate every render site INSIDE the component too.** PR #96's
  paragraph fix changed the `proseSections.map()` block in `CoursePage.tsx` and stopped —
  leaving `prose.overview`, the lead paragraph above the fold, on the raw-string path. Both
  now route through one `splitParagraphs()` helper so they cannot drift. This is the shape
  this file already warns about ("fixing the cheap string and leaving the prominent one"),
  committed in the same session that quoted the warning. Grep the component for every use of
  the data you are fixing, not just the block you opened. Rendering that fix then exposed
  what the run-on had been concealing: `chiang-mai/hang-dong-golf-club`'s overview opened with
  a literal `PUBLISHING NOTE:` internal memo, live on an indexed page and emitted as the
  `GolfCourse` JSON-LD `description`. **An enumeration used only to size a change is not an
  inspection** — when a fix reveals hidden content, read a sample of what it reveals.
- **Validate i18n house style:** `npm run validate:i18n` — lints localized guide content (ja/ko/zh/th entries in `data/explainer-pages.ts` and `data/faq-pages.ts`, `REGION_HUB_I18N` in `data/golf-courses-i18n.ts`, `PRICE_TIER_I18N` in `data/price-tiers.ts`, per-course `locales.<locale>` in `data/golf-courses/*/*.ts`, the non-EN blocks of `CONTENT` in `data/faq-hub.ts`) plus the **UI chrome strings in `messages/{ja,ko,zh,th}.json`** against the machine-readable glossaries in `data/i18n-glossary/*.json`. ERROR-level (fails): emoji, exclamation marks, full-width digits (ja), terminology `avoid` variants, brand-immutable case corruption, unbalanced `**`/unbalanced braces (see the ICU bullet below), and a UI-message namespace entirely missing from a locale catalog (see next bullet). WARN-level (non-blocking): currency-convention drift, unscoped honesty claims, prices with no "as of" marker, individual UI-message key gaps vs `messages/en.json`. Automates the mechanical subset of `docs/i18n-review-checklist.md`; `--self-test` proves the detectors. No server needed.
- **`checkScript` answers "is this string even in this language?" — and its tuning is the whole check.** Added after a zh paragraph shipped in a `th` slot on an indexed page (above). Two rules, both needed. **(a) Dominance:** foreign-script characters outnumber the locale's own by **2x**, above a floor of 8. **(b) ja-only kana requirement:** ≥30 kanji with zero kana. Rule (b) exists because dominance is *blind* to zh→ja — Han is legal in Japanese, so a Chinese paragraph in a `ja` slot scores 100% "own"; kana is the only discriminator. **Do NOT "simplify" this to "contains a script this language doesn't use".** That version flagged **eleven strings, every one correct copy**: `directions.grabTip` in ja/ko/zh deliberately prints the venue name in **Thai** so a reader can show it to a taxi driver; `스크린골프` is quoted as a term of art in the th/zh screen-golf explainer; `한국어` is the Korean entry in the language switcher; and `毎日午前9時〜午後11時営業` / `平日 = 月〜木、週末 = 金〜日` / `動画撮影 / 写真撮影` are ordinary all-kanji ja catalog strings. A gate that fires 11 times on correct code gets switched off. **The 2x margin is thin and load-bearing:** Chinese is denser than Thai, so the 25-character Thai address quoted inside the zh `grabTip` outnumbers the 22 Han around it — a plurality rule flags it, 2x clears it. That string is pinned **verbatim** as a self-test (an invented shorter version of it failed), so shortening it in `faq-hub.ts` will turn the gate red; keep the two in sync. **Known limit:** rule (b) requires kana to be *exactly* zero, so it catches a whole-slot swap but **not a partial one** — found by mutation, when replacing only a paragraph's first sentence left a Japanese tail and the check correctly stayed green. Tightening to a kana/kanji ratio would catch that and would fire on legitimately kanji-dense Japanese. Half-translated strings stay native QA's job.
- **The `messages/*.json` corpus is ERROR-checks-only** (`uiChrome` in `scripts/validate-i18n.ts`). The three WARN checks are entry-shaped prose rules that don't transfer to microcopy: `price-as-of` assumes an entry is an article that can carry a date marker in its prose, but a hero subtitle reading `1時間550バーツ〜` has nowhere to put one (the live price lives in `data/pricing.ts`); `currency` and `honesty` are calibrated for long-form text and misfire on 3-word stat badges. Running them over the catalogs would have added ~200 standing warnings, which is how a linter teaches people to ignore it. English is excluded from this corpus by design — the glossaries encode *target*-language terminology, so linting the source language against them is meaningless.
- **`checkMarkup` runs TWO brace rules, split by dialect — do not collapse them.** `checkMarkup()` in `scripts/validate-i18n.ts` used to count literal `{{` vs `}}` bigrams. That fit the `{{token}}` placeholders in `data/explainer-pages.ts` but hard-failed every ICU plural, because `{count, plural, =1 {…} other {# …}}` ends in a `}}` with no `{{` anywhere; `messages/en.json` is excluded from the corpus so EN never hit it, and the non-EN workaround was a **load-bearing space** before the final brace. Since PR #88 the check is (a) a structural brace **depth-scan** on everything, plus (b) the old bigram equality **scoped to the `{{token}}` dialect** (non-`uiChrome` units) via the `dialect` parameter. Both are needed, and **depth-scanning alone is weaker, not stronger** — this was the review finding on PR #88 after exactly that claim was made: `{{bayHourlyFrom} }` is brace-*balanced* and sails through the depth-scan, but `lib/site-facts.ts` substitutes on `/\{\{\s*(\w+)\s*\}\}/g`, so the split closer misses the anchor, `replace()` no-ops, and the raw token ships to visitors **without throwing** (the throw there only fires for well-formed tokens with unknown names). That shape is the load-bearing space itself. Conversely the depth-scan catches `}}{{`, which the bigram counter passed 1-for-1. The scoping is safe only because the dialects don't mix: `messages/*.json` has no `{{token}}`, the content data has no ICU. Known gap: ICU escapes a literal brace by quoting (`Use '{' here`), which the depth-scan reads as unclosed — nothing does this today; strip ICU-quoted spans before scanning if it ever comes up. **When adding an ICU plural to a non-EN catalog, write it normally — no spacing tricks.**
- **Pluralization is a per-language decision, not a mechanical five-locale edit.** Precedent: `GolfCourseRegion.metaDescription` rendered "all 1 golf courses" on the three single-course region hubs (`north-misc`, `khao-lak`, `krabi` — `courseCount: 1` in `REGION_META`). EN needed a real `plural` with a `=1` branch. **TH did not** — Thai has no grammatical plural and `1 แห่ง` was already correct; the awkwardness was `ครบทั้ง` ("the complete set of") applied to one item, so its `=1` branch drops that phrase and keeps the same measure word. **ja/ko/zh needed no change at all** — no plural morphology, and `{count}か所 / {count}곳 / {count}座` read correctly at 1. Don't reach for `{count, plural, …}` in a CJK catalog just because EN got one. The corollary for the `GolfCourseHub` region cards: the count must live **inside** the message (`coursesCount`) rather than being interpolated next to a bare noun key, because a noun sitting outside the message has no `count` to agree with — that is exactly how "1 courses" shipped. All five locales carry `coursesCount`; only EN inflects.
- **Adding a course-content locale is a `lib/format.ts` change, and the compiler only catches part of it.** `COURSE_CONTENT_LOCALES` there is the single-source union (`FormatLocale` = `CourseSeoLocale`) behind every localized course-detail surface. Widening it (`['en','th','ja']` → `+ ko, zh` for the ko/zh course-detail batch) makes TypeScript enumerate most of the follow-on work, because the consumers are exhaustive `Record<FormatLocale, …>` maps: `DRIVE_TIME_L10N` (`lib/format.ts`), and `PROVINCE_L10N` + `FAQ_L10N` (`lib/course-seo.ts`, the latter a full 11-method pack per locale feeding both the on-page FAQ and its JSON-LD). **`asOfMonthYear` is the exception and the trap** — it is a `switch` with a `default:` arm returning the `en-US` short month, so a new locale compiles clean and silently emits "Jul 2026" inside Korean prose. Add its `case` by hand. (`lib/currency-rates.ts` already carries ko/ja/zh cases.) `PROVINCE_L10N` is separately guarded: `validate:i18n` errors when a registered course's province has no entry for that locale.
- **ZH province names are exonyms, not transcriptions; KO transcribes.** `PROVINCE_L10N` uses `大城府` (Ayutthaya), `北榄府` (Samut Prakan), `佛统府` (Nakhon Pathom) — the names Chinese sources actually use — because a coined `阿育他亚` would be both unidiomatic and unsearchable. Korean has no exonym tradition for Thai provinces, so it transcribes per the Korean standard for Thai, with tense consonants: `푸껫`, `빠툼타니`, `사뭇쁘라깐`. Do not "regularize" one to match the other.
- **Korean templates must never attach a particle directly to an interpolated proper noun.** Korean topic/object particles alternate on the preceding syllable's final consonant (은/는, 을/를), which cannot be resolved for a Latin course name — `Alpine Golf Club은(는)` is the shipped-looking failure. The `ko` pack in `FAQ_L10N` therefore either follows `${name}` with a Korean noun that carries the particle itself (`${name} 코스는`, `${name} 그린피는`) or uses a consonant-invariant particle (`에서`/`에는`/`의`). Nothing lints this — keep the invariant by hand when editing those templates, and apply the same rule to any new Korean string that interpolates a name.
- **The per-course href invariant needs BOTH halves, and a translation batch invalidates the negative one.** `courseDetailHref()` (PR #88) prefixes a course link only where that course is translated, so the smoke test pins a positive assertion (a translated course IS prefixed) and a negative one (an untranslated course is NOT). PR #88 wrote the negative half as "ko prefixes nothing", which was only true while ko had zero course-detail translations — the ko/zh batch made all three of those assertions wrong. The fix is to re-anchor the negative to a course genuinely absent from `COURSE_DETAIL_I18N` (currently `lakewood-country-club`), **not** to delete it: dropping it leaves an always-prefix regression — the exact bug PR #88 fixed in `HubMapExplorer` — completely unguarded. Treat the slug as an invariant, not a constant: if a future batch translates it, move the assertion to another untranslated course. Related: do **not** pin an untranslated-course negative on `/golf-courses/under/<tier>/`, whose roster is a derived top 12, for the same reason the `/compare/` redirects are fragile.
- **Emoji detection is an allowlist subtraction, not a narrowed property test.** `emojiHit()` in `scripts/validate-i18n.ts` strips `© ® ™ ★ ☆` and then tests `\p{Emoji_Presentation}|\p{Extended_Pictographic}`. Adding the `messages/*.json` corpus exposed two false positives in the old bare-`Extended_Pictographic` check: the `©` in `© {year} LENGOLF CO., LTD.` (a legal mark, identical in the English source) and the `★` in `★{rating} / Googleレビュー{count}件` (a rating glyph in the trust chip). **Do not "fix" that by narrowing to `\p{Emoji_Presentation}`** — that silently disarms the check for every pictograph defaulting to text presentation (`❤ ⚠ ➡ ✔ ✈ ☀`), and browsers colour a bare `❤` anyway, so it ships as decoration with the linter silent. Two false positives aren't worth six false negatives; this was caught in review on PR #73 after exactly that narrowing was proposed. The `Emoji_Presentation` alternative is kept because it adds regional-indicator flags (🇯🇵), which aren't `Extended_Pictographic` and which the original check missed. Self-test asserts both directions, including that bare text-presentation pictographs still fail.
- **The `price-as-of` detector is plain-substring too, and its failure mode is a silent false NEGATIVE.** It looks for the locale's as-of marker token anywhere in the entry — `ข้อมูล ณ` (th), `現在` (ja), `기준` (ko), `截至` (zh). Those last two are ordinary high-frequency words: ko `기준` means "based on / as measured from", so natural golf prose like `백 티 기준 6,380야드` ("6,380 yards from the back tee") or `스팀프미터 기준 10.5` satisfies the detector and suppresses the warning for the WHOLE entry, even though no date was ever stated. ja `現在` has the same shape (pre-existing on `phuket-country-club`). Two builders hit this independently in the ko/zh course-detail batch; one rewrote `스팀프미터 기준 10.5` → `스팀프미터 10.5 이상` specifically so the entry would warn like its th/ja siblings. Consequence: a **missing** `price-as-of` warning on a ko/zh entry proves nothing — grep the entry for a real date before concluding it carries one. Do not "fix" this by making the marker match stricter without checking what it would newly flag; the warning is non-blocking, so a false negative costs less than churning 300+ existing entries.
- **A typed fee field can disagree with every locale's prose, and the FAQ generator will print both.** `phuket-country-club` carries `green_fee_weekday_thb: 2800` / `green_fee_weekend_thb: 4000`, but the EN meta and the th/ja/ko/zh prose all frame those same two numbers as **low season / high season**. `validate:courses` passes (weekend > weekday, both plausible) and nothing cross-checks prose against field semantics. Because `FAQ_L10N.feeAnswer` builds the fee FAQ from the TYPED fields, the page renders "low season / high season" in its body next to an auto-generated FAQ saying "weekday / weekend" — and the FAQ copy also ships as JSON-LD `FAQPage` structured data. **Took FOUR rounds to resolve, because each round's "all consumers now honor it" was false.** Do not trust that sentence when you read it — including here. The label decision is centralized in **`lib/course-fees.ts`** (`pricesByDayOfWeek` / `feeLabelKeys` / `feeLabelsEn` / `feeBasisNoteEn`); **route every new label site through it rather than writing another `fee_is_seasonal ?` ternary.** The real lesson: **this is a cross-cutting content decision, and duplicating it per call site guarantees a miss.** The rounds, so the shape is recognizable: (1) shipped wired into the FAQ generator only — fee table and JSON-LD `Offer` still said weekday/weekend; (2) "fixed everywhere" while the compare route emitted *"costs less on Saturday/Sunday"* on an **indexed** URL; (3) "fixed everywhere" while `under/[tier]` said *"Weekday from 2,800 THB"*, the region-hub roster tagged the higher fee `wknd`, and `SpecTable` had patched the fee **value** but left the row **label** contradicting it on the same line; (4) "fixed everywhere" while the `/golf-courses/under/<tier>/` **page chrome** (`metaDescription`, `eyebrowBadge`, `topCoursesHeading`) still asserted a weekday basis in all five locales directly above the low-season item, and `/guide/nikanti-golf-club-bangkok` still advised tipping the caddie two lines above stating the tip is included. **Fixing the cheap string and leaving the prominent one is the recurring shape of this bug.** Practical rules: grep `green_fee_weekday_thb` with **NO directory scoping** (`data/golf-courses-use-cases.ts` sits outside `lib/ components/ app/`); a **shared header or page-level chrome can only name a basis when every course beneath it agrees**, otherwise it goes basis-neutral; and a flag-shaped grep (`caddie_tip_included`) finds only the consumer that reads the flag and **cannot** find prose written before it existed — search the claim, not the field. Note `lib/course-seo.ts` **suppresses** the generated fee FAQ and the meta fee line for a seasonal course rather than relabelling them, so `phuket-country-club` ships no price FAQ at all while every sibling has one — a known content gap, not a false claim. When adding a locale to a course, still check the typed fields mean what the prose says. **Sibling pattern — `caddie_tip_included`:** Nikanti's all-inclusive green fee covers the caddie tip, but `FAQ_L10N.caddieAnswer` hard-appended "Caddie tips … are customary on top" for *every* mandatory-caddie course — contradicting the course's own copy, in `FAQPage` structured data. A `caddie_tip_included` flag (set on Nikanti, threaded through `caddieAnswer(name, required, fee, tipIncluded)`) now switches that clause to "the tip is already included — no extra tipping expected." Do NOT key seasonal-or-tip-inclusive behavior off `caddie_fee_thb: 0` or a bare fee value — seven courses carry `caddie_fee_thb: 0` without being all-inclusive (eight have the zero; Nikanti is the one that really is all-inclusive); use the explicit flag.
- **`checkTerminology` is plain-substring, so an `avoid` token can false-positive inside a longer legitimate word.** Precedent (PR #73): zh `avoid: ["球场费"]` (wrong form of *green fee*) matched inside `球场费用` — which was translating "on-course fee", a deliberately broader liability covering caddie/cart/transfer. "Correcting" it to `果岭费用` narrowed a live customer-liability line on the zh `/lessons` page. Resolved by rewording to `下场费用`, which keeps the breadth and contains neither token. When this check fires, confirm the flagged phrase actually means the glossary term before rewriting it — check `messages/en.json` and the ja/ko renderings first.
- **Dead English entries in the CJK catalogs are expected, not bugs.** `Home.*`, `HomeFaq.*` and `SecondHandClubs*` are still English in `messages/{ko,zh}.json` (and `SecondHandClubs*` in `ja` too). They never render: `app/[locale]/page.tsx` returns the bespoke `JapanLandingPage`/`KoreaLandingPage`/`ChinaLandingPage` before `getTranslations('Home')` or `'HomeFaq'` is reached, and `/second-hand-golf-clubs-bangkok` is EN-only (untranslated locale routes 301 to English). Don't "fix" them by translating without first confirming a consumer exists, and don't read the `!` in them as live copy.
- **UI-message namespace parity (part of `validate:i18n`):** when a page starts SSG-ing a new locale (e.g. adding entries to `getTranslatedPriceTierParams()`), every `useTranslations('...')` namespace it consumes must exist in that locale's `messages/<locale>.json` — next-intl logs `MISSING_MESSAGE` per render during build and silently falls back to English (no build failure), so a repeated `MISSING_MESSAGE` in the build log is a real bug, not noise. `validate:i18n` guards this for the namespaces in the `SSG_UI_NAMESPACES` allowlist (`scripts/validate-i18n.ts`: `GolfCourseShared`, `GolfCoursePriceTier`, `GolfCourseRegion`, `GolfCourseHub`, `GolfCourseDetail`, `ExplainerPage`, `FaqPage`, `ContactInfo`): the locales that SSG those pages — derived from the registry helpers in `lib/translated-routes.ts` — must have the namespace in `messages/<locale>.json` with the same (flattened) key set as `messages/en.json`. Namespace missing entirely = ERROR; individual missing keys = WARN. Precedent: `GolfCourseShared` was missing from ja/ko/zh (~480 warnings/build) until PR #78. When a translated route starts consuming a NEW namespace, add it to `SSG_UI_NAMESPACES`; namespaces outside the allowlist are still unchecked.
- **The untranslated-locale intercept in `middleware.ts` must only fire on a PURE prefix-add.** The block that rewrites to `/en` keys off "does the redirect TARGET start with a locale prefix?" — but next-intl emits locale-prefixed redirects for a *second* reason: it matches the prefix case-INsensitively and 307s `/JA/x/` to `/ja/x/` to canonicalize it, while the 301 loop at the top of the file is case-SENSITIVE and skips it. Without the `pathWithoutLocale !== pathname` guard, that canonicalization got intercepted too, and every case variant of every locale (`/JA/`, `/Ja/`, `/TH/`, `/ZH/`…) served a **200 English page at the variant URL** instead of redirecting — an indexable soft-duplicate, where the pre-fix code had correctly done 307 → 301 → canonical. Same guard also sends the slash-less form (`/x` with `trailingSlash: true`) back through canonicalization instead of 200-ing at a non-canonical URL. When editing this block, re-verify with `curl -sI -H 'Accept-Language: ja' <base>/JA/golf-in-thailand-guide/` — it must NOT be 200. The root arm builds `/en${pathWithoutLocale}` (not `/en` + a stripped `''`) so the trailing slash survives; it is unreachable while `"/"` is translated in every locale, and wrong the moment it isn't.
- **A new SEO section is not linted until it is added to the `validate:i18n` corpus by hand — importing it is not enough.** `hotelConciergePages` was imported into `scripts/validate-i18n.ts` for the SSG-namespace check and *looked* wired, but it was missing from the `for (const [label, pages] of [...])` corpus tuple, so PR #90's 48 `/hotels` translations shipped with **zero** house-style checking — no emoji, exclamation, full-width-digit, terminology or brand-casing gate — on the one section that also shipped without native-language QA. A clean `validate:i18n` run proves nothing about a section that isn't in that tuple; the entry count in the success line (`763 localized entries`) is the thing to sanity-check after adding one. Prove the wiring by injection (an emoji + `！` into a ja entry must fail), not by a green run. Non-prose leaves need naming in `NON_PROSE_SEO_FIELD_RE` — URLs (`google_maps_embed`), clock times (`suggested_itinerary[].time`) — or the brand/terminology checks fire on identifiers. **The same trap is live right now, unfixed:** `lib/course-seo.ts` is imported into the linter only for `hasProvinceL10n`, so `FAQ_L10N` — eleven prose templates per locale, rendering as the on-page course FAQ *and* as JSON-LD `FAQPage` — gets **no** house-style checking, including the ko templates that carry the hand-maintained particle invariant. Linting it is not a one-line import: the units are functions, so the corpus loop would have to invoke them with representative arguments.
- **A gate that cannot fail is worse than no gate, and the empty-input path is how it happens.** Four of this repo's checks could pass vacuously before PR #90's review pass: `validate:hotels` printed "0 entries pass" and exited 0 on an empty corpus; its LENGOLF-card cross-check was `find(...) && ...`, so renaming the card disarmed the one defect it existed for; `validate:links`'s stale-probe parser did `slice(indexOf(a), indexOf(b))`, and a renamed marker makes `indexOf` return -1, which clamps to an **empty string** and examines nothing; and `verify:coordinates --write` printed its WRITE FAILED section to stdout and still exited 0. Every new gate needs (a) a minimum-input floor with a real number, not `> 0`, (b) an existence assertion before any `X && compare(X)`, and (c) `process.exit`/`exitCode` on every failure path. Verify by breaking the input on purpose and watching it go red — a green run on good data is not evidence.
- **FAQ `answer_body` renders `- ` bullets AND `N. ` ordinals; the old "convert numbered lists to bullets" workaround is dead.** `renderParagraph()` in `components/faq/FaqPage.tsx` used to treat only `- ` lines as a list. A block of `1. ` / `2. ` lines matched neither the list branch nor the mixed intro+list branch and fell through to the plain `<p>` renderer, where the single `\n` between items collapses in HTML and the whole list shipped as one run-on sentence. That was live on **36 blocks across 15 EN entries** and identically on ja/ko/zh (31 blocks each), because translators faithfully carry the source's numbering. Several batches worked around it by rewriting `N. ` → `- ` per locale, which silently discarded ordinality on sequence-bearing lists (booking steps, the caddie loop). `LIST_ITEM_RE` now matches both forms and numbered blocks render as `<ol class="list-decimal">`. **Write numbered lists normally** — do not convert them, and do not "fix" a locale to match a sibling that was converted under the old rule. The trailing `\s+` in the regex is load-bearing: it keeps a line opening `2.5 hours for a round` a paragraph rather than an ordinal.
- **Body markdown is `**bold**`-only:** explainer/FAQ `body` strings are rendered by `components/shared/BoldText.tsx`, which handles `**bold**` but NOT single-asterisk `*italics*` — italic markup ships as literal asterisks (one pre-existing case: the exchange-rate footnote in `gg-thailand-golf-trip-cost`). Write footnote/aside lines as plain text, e.g. the as-of markers `(ข้อมูล ณ กรกฎาคม 2026)`.
- **Validate course fees and region rosters:** `npm run validate:courses` — lints `data/golf-courses/*/*.ts`. Two ERROR classes (either fails CI). **Fees:** fee outside ฿150–฿20,000, weekend cheaper than weekday, malformed `fees_verified_at`, or a suspicious pattern (weekday under ฿600 — the classic scraped Thai-national/9-hole/promo rate — or weekend >2.2× weekday) on a course with no `fees_verified_at` attestation. **Region rosters** (`checkRegionCounts`): `REGION_META.courseCount` in `lib/golf-courses.ts` disagreeing with the region's `index.ts` slugs, an index slug with no file, a file with no index slug, a missing `index.ts`, or a course directory with no `REGION_META` entry. Three sources of truth — the advertised count, the `index.ts` slugs that actually render, and the files on disk — and a re-region that updates two of the three leaves the hub advertising a number it does not render *and* possibly selecting the wrong ICU plural branch. Files are keyed by DIRECTORY, not by the `region` field, because the directory builds the URL. WARN: attested-but-suspicious fees, attestations older than 18 months, coordinates rounded below 3dp, `coordinates_verified_at` over 18 months old. When correcting a fee, also grep the course's `prose` for the old number — fees are often repeated in prose text. No server needed.
- **Course edits can silently delete /compare/ pages:** `/golf-courses/compare/<region>/<pair>` URLs are DERIVED from each region's top 3 by `popularityScore()` (fee + prose>200 chars + website + driving_range) with `dynamicParams = false` and sitemap emission — so a fee correction, an added `website`, lengthened prose, or a re-region can retire an indexed pair as a hard 404 with CI green. Margins are thin (khao-yai: 50 points; kanchanaburi: a three-way tie broken alphabetically). Until a snapshot guard lands, recompute the affected regions' top 3 before/after any such edit (`lib/golf-courses-derived.ts`), and add redirects for retired pairs. Reverse trap: those redirects match BEFORE the filesystem, so if a pair re-enters its top 3, delete its redirect from `next.config.js` or the regenerated page is unreachable behind its own 308.
- **Verify course coordinates:** `npm run verify:coordinates` (report) / `npm run verify:coordinates -- --write` (apply). Batch-checks every course's lat/lng against the Google Places API and stamps `coordinates_verified_at`. Needs a **server-side** key: `GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_API_KEY=... npm run verify:coordinates` — do NOT reuse `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_EMBED_KEY` if it is HTTP-referrer restricted (referrer-locked keys reject server calls). Costs a Places Text Search per course (~149 requests). Coordinates gate real output: `hasTrustedCoordinates()` in `lib/geo.ts` withholds the satellite map pin and schema.org `GeoCoordinates` unless the coordinates are attested or precise to ≥3dp, and `courseMapsUrl()` falls back to a name+province Google search rather than linking unverified coordinates.
- **Smoke tests:** `npm run test:smoke` (requires a running server on localhost:3000)
- **Page inventory:** `npm run inventory [base-url]` — table of published pages per section × language (EN/TH/JA/KO/ZH), parsed from the sitemap. Needs a running server **with DB access** (real `.env.local`), else DB-driven blog/location sections read 0. Point at prod with `npm run inventory https://www.len.golf`.
- **Migrate blog posts:** `npx tsx scripts/migrate-blog-posts.ts` (one-time migration, already run)
- **Import location pages:** `npx tsx scripts/import-location-pages.ts` (one-time migration, already run)

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every PR to `main`:

- **`lint`** — `npm run lint` with ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`), then `npm run validate:links` (internal SEO cross-link validator), then `npm run validate:i18n` (i18n house-style/honesty linter — mechanical subset of the native-QA rubric), then `npm run validate:courses` (green-fee plausibility **and** region-roster/`courseCount` agreement gate; a red "lint" check can be any of the four)
- **`build-and-smoke`** — builds the app, starts the production server, runs smoke tests across 19 categories (per-category test counts live in `scripts/smoke-test.ts`):
  - **A) Route tests** — pages across all locales return 200 with `<main id="main-content">`
  - **B) Redirect tests** — WordPress legacy URLs, GSC 404 fixes, and location redirects
  - **C) Link checks** — booking.len.golf, LINE, Supabase Storage assets are reachable
  - **D) SEO checks** — title, meta description, canonical (www.len.golf), JSON-LD, `lang` attribute
  - **E) Locale redirect tests** — untranslated th/ko/ja/zh routes redirect to English
  - **F) Locale cookie tests** — English pages work with a NEXT_LOCALE cookie set
  - **G) WordPress 404 tests** — legacy WordPress paths return 404 (prevent redirect regressions)
  - **H) LLM / AI discoverability** — llms.txt served as text, robots.txt names AI crawlers, opening-hours schema consistent
  - **I) Translated-guide registry consistency** — the `/guide/...` allowlist in `lib/translated-routes.ts` must match the locale-tagged entries in `data/explainer-pages.ts` (pure import check, no server)
  - **J) Translated region-hub registry consistency** — the `/golf-courses/<region>` allowlist in `lib/translated-routes.ts` must match the translations in `data/golf-courses-i18n.ts` (pure import check, no server)
  - **J2) Translated price-tier registry consistency** — the `/golf-courses/under/<tier>` allowlist in `lib/translated-routes.ts` must match the translations in `data/price-tiers.ts` (pure import check, no server)
  - **J3) Translated course-detail registry consistency** — the `/golf-courses/<region>/<slug>` allowlist in `lib/translated-routes.ts` must match `COURSE_DETAIL_I18N` in `data/golf-courses-i18n.ts` both directions (pure import check, no server); with `dynamicParams = false` on the route, a one-sided edit is a hard 404 advertised by hreflang
  - **K) Data-driven internal-link liveness** — every `related_slugs` path outside the statically-validated SEO prefixes (`/location`, `/golf-courses`, core routes) is fetched live and must not 404 (complements `npm run validate:links`)
  - **L) Blog translated-slug registry liveness** — every path registered in `data/blog-translated-slugs.ts` must serve 200 (catches the data file running ahead of the DB, which `dynamicParams = false` turns into a 404)
  - **L2) Course-detail translated registry liveness** — every registered `/golf-courses/<region>/<slug>` translation must serve 200 **with** `<main id="main-content">`; derived from the registry, so new translation batches are covered with zero routeTests edits (routeTests keeps one th + one ja canary only)
  - **L3) Region-hub translated registry liveness** — every registered `/golf-courses/<region>` translation must serve 200 with `<main id="main-content">`. L2's guard one level up the hub tree, and registry-derived like L2, so a future region batch needs zero routeTests edits (56 hub URLs covered today)
  - **L4) FAQ translated registry liveness** — every registered `/faq/<slug>` translation must serve 200 with `<main id="main-content">` **and no unresolved `{{`**. Until this landed, translated FAQ pages were the only translated section with *no liveness assertion at all*: section I proved registry ⇄ data agreement, which is not the same thing — both sides can agree on a slug whose page throws at render or serves a 200 error shell. The `{{` assertion exists because **FAQ pages are the inverse of the guide rule on fact tokens**: the FAQ route renders `answer_intro`/`answer_body` verbatim and never calls `interpolateFacts` (only `/guide/` and `llms.txt` do), so a `{{token}}` copied in from a guide entry ships raw to the reader with nothing throwing. Registry-derived like L2/L3, so future FAQ batches need zero routeTests edits (124 FAQ URLs covered).
  - **M) Wayfinding copy** — BTS Chidlom is **Exit 4** (The Mercury Ville). 14 assertions: the six DB-driven `/location/*-chidlom` pages (`location_pages.bts_route`, unreachable by any static lint), plus the repo-owned strings — `HomeJa/HomeKo/HomeZh.accessBts` in `messages/*.json` (3), the hardcoded EN line in `app/[locale]/golf-in-thailand-guide/page.tsx` (1), and `directions.steps` in `data/faq-hub.ts` on `/{th,ja,ko,zh}/faq/` (4). The faq-hub four are a **second, independent copy** of the wayfinding: the landing-page checks read `messages/*.json` and would all still pass if faq-hub regressed. Each check is a matched pair — correct string present *and* wrong-exit shape absent — so dropped copy fails rather than passing vacuously. Assertions run against rendered markup with `<script>` blocks stripped: `NextIntlClientProvider` is handed the whole locale catalog, so an un-stripped body would let a string that never renders satisfy the check.
  - **N) Region-hub course-count agreement** — three regions hold one course (`north-misc`, `khao-lak`, `krabi`), so `GolfCourseRegion.metaDescription` carries an ICU plural in EN and TH and **both branches are asserted in both languages** (`=1` on all three regions, `other` on bangkok), plus the `/golf-courses/` region cards, which render the count in **visible** copy and shipped "1 courses" until PR #88. Meta-tag checks read the `<meta name="description">` attribute; the card check strips tags first, because the count and the noun live in separate elements and the disagreement exists only in the rendered text. Counts match `\d+`, not `\d\d+` — nine of fourteen regions are single-digit.

Both jobs are **required checks** via branch protection — PRs cannot merge if either fails.

**Manual trigger:** `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main`

**GitHub Secrets required:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (already configured)

**Key files:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — workflow definition
- `scripts/smoke-test.ts` — smoke test script (zero deps beyond tsx + Node.js fetch)
- `eslint.config.mjs` — ESLint flat config (next/core-web-vitals)

**Adding new routes:** When adding a new page, add it to `routeTests` in `scripts/smoke-test.ts` to ensure CI validates it.

## Migration Notes

Migrated from WordPress (Elementor + 24 plugins). All migration artifacts live in `_migration/` (gitignored). Migration scripts in `scripts/` are one-time utilities that have already been run. The site has 16 pages, 24 blog posts, and 101 location pages (7 template types across ~15 Bangkok neighborhoods).

## Architecture

### Routing (App Router)

- `app/[locale]/` — Next.js App Router pages with i18n support (EN/TH)
- Core pages: `/golf`, `/events`, `/lessons`, `/about-us`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`
- Content pages: `/golf-club-rental`, `/golf-course-club-rental`, `/activities`, `/cost`, `/faq`, `/guide`, `/hotels`, `/second-hand-golf-clubs-bangkok`
- Dynamic routes: `/blog/[slug]`, `/location/[slug]` — use `generateStaticParams` + ISR (revalidate: 3600s)
- API routes: `app/api/contact/route.ts` (POST — contact form), `app/api/aqi/route.ts` (air quality)

### Components

- `components/layout/` — Header, Footer, LineChatWidget
- `components/home/`, `components/about/`, `components/events/`, `components/location/` — core page components
- `components/activities/`, `components/blog/`, `components/clubs/`, `components/faq/`, `components/guides/`, `components/hotels/`, `components/prices/` — content page components
- `components/shared/` — reusable components (BookingCTA, ContactInfo, ImageGallery, SectionWrapper, SocialIcons)
- `components/ui/` — shadcn/ui primitives (Radix UI + Tailwind)

### Data Layer

- **Supabase** is the sole database (PostgreSQL). Client initialized in `lib/supabase/client.ts` with anonymous key (no auth, `persistSession: false`).
- **Supabase Storage** hosts all static assets (images, videos) in the `website-assets` public bucket. Assets are organized into folders: `branding/`, `venue/`, `golf/`, `events/`, `lessons/`, `tournaments/`, `menus/`, `icons/`, `promotions/`, `videos/`. Use `storageUrl('folder/file.ext')` from `lib/constants.ts` to generate URLs. Only `favicon.png` remains in `public/images/`.
- Three tables: `blog_posts`, `contact_submissions`, `location_pages` (types in `types/supabase.ts`)
- Data fetching helpers: `lib/blog.ts`, `lib/locations.ts`
- Static data: `data/pricing.ts`, `data/coaches.ts`, `data/faq-pages.ts`, `data/faq-hub.ts` (/faq/ hub page content, EN+TH+JA+KO+ZH — the `CONTENT` record at the foot of the file is the launch gate for a locale), `data/hotel-pages.ts`, `data/explainer-pages.ts`, `data/price-guide-pages.ts`, `data/activity-occasions.ts`, `data/event-clients.ts`
- Location pages have rich schema: template_type, distance/transit metrics, area descriptions, SEO content, JSON-LD schema_markup

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS with custom theme in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Brand colors: primary green `#005a32`, accent gold `#c8a96e`, secondary dark `#1a1a1a`
- Font: Poppins (loaded via next/font)

### Key Utilities

- `lib/constants.ts` — site name, URLs, business info, navigation items, `storageUrl()` helper
- `lib/jsonld.ts` — JSON-LD structured data (LocalBusiness schema)
- `lib/utils.ts` — `cn()` helper (clsx + tailwind-merge)

### Forms

- react-hook-form + Zod for validation
- Contact form (`components/about/ContactForm.tsx`) and event inquiry form (`components/events/EventInquiryForm.tsx`)

### SEO

- Dynamic metadata via `generateMetadata` on each page
- `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts` for search engine configuration
- Google Tag Manager via `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID`
- Location pages include per-page JSON-LD schema markup

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local` (see `.env.local.example`):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase connection
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` — Google Tag Manager
- `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO` — Contact form recipient

For migration scripts only:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — elevated access for data imports

## `vercel.json` pins `regions: ["sin1"]`

Supabase is in `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore). Without a pin, functions run in
Vercel's US default (`iad1`, Washington DC) and every PostgREST call crosses the
Pacific — ~230ms RTT, plus 2–3 more for a cold TLS handshake.

**This matters far less here than it sounds**, and it's worth knowing why before
anyone quotes a big number about it. This site is static/ISR: every page uses
`generateStaticParams` and `revalidate`, so the Supabase reads in `lib/blog.ts`,
`lib/clubs.ts`, `lib/promotions.ts` and friends happen at build time and during
background revalidation, not while a visitor waits. Sampled pages come back
`HIT` / `PRERENDER` / `STALE`, never a per-request render.

The one user-facing surface that pays is `POST /api/contact`, which awaits a
Supabase insert into `contact_submissions` before responding — roughly one round
trip. Its SMTP is `smtp.gmail.com` (anycast), so unlike `lengolf-booking-new`'s
Thai-hosted mail server there's no additional penalty on the email leg.

Check the execution region with the response header. The **second** segment is
where the function ran; the first is only the edge PoP that accepted the
connection:

```bash
curl -sI https://www.len.golf/ | grep -i x-vercel-id
```

`sin1::sin1::…` is correct. `::iad1::` means the pin was lost.

`preferredRegion` does NOT work for this — it's edge-runtime only and these
routes are Node. Top-level `regions` in `vercel.json` is the mechanism.

Sibling apps `lengolf-forms` and `lengolf-booking-new` pin the same region. In
booking-new the cost was severe rather than cosmetic — ~165ms of real query work
read as ~4s of wall clock — because its routes make five or six sequential
queries per request and its SMTP host is in Thailand.

## Path Alias

`@/*` maps to project root (e.g., `@/components/ui/button`).

## Migration Archive

All migration artifacts live in `_migration/` (gitignored, excluded from builds). Contains WordPress backup, markdown exports, import scripts, and SEO planning docs.

## 🔒 Supabase Security — Non-Negotiable Rules

The shared Lengolf Supabase was hardened after a security audit. Don't regress it.

### The single most important rule

**This project has ZERO legitimate browser-anon Supabase usage.** Every
database read (blog, clubs, locations, promotions, Google reviews, contact
form) happens server-side via `lib/supabase/client.ts`, which uses
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and is marked `import 'server-only'`.

**Never change the env var back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.** The
server-side anon grants the old factory depended on have been revoked
project-wide, so reverting would break every page on len.golf that shows
data from the DB.

### Type-only imports from client components are fine

```ts
import type { UsedClub } from '@/lib/clubs'  // OK — erased at build time
```
**Runtime** imports from a `'use client'` component will fail the build
via `server-only`. Keep it that way.

### If you ever think you need browser-side Supabase access

Stop and ask. The current static-marketing-site design doesn't need it.
If there's a real interactive use case, prefer a server component that
fetches at request time, or a new API route using the existing factory.

### Hard red flags — stop and reconsider

- A `'use client'` component with a runtime `import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'`
- Any inline `createClient(..., process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)`
- A new Supabase factory file missing `import 'server-only'` at the top
- Any migration in the shared Lengolf DB that does `GRANT ALL ... TO anon` on the public or backoffice schemas
