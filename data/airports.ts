/**
 * Airports used as anchors for the /golf-courses/near/[airport]/ proximity
 * pages. Mirrors the BTS-station registry (data/bts-stations.ts) but carries
 * richer, booking-intent copy because airport searchers arrive with a clear
 * "book golf near the airport" intent rather than a hotel-district context.
 *
 * Coordinates are the official terminal coordinates for each airport. They are
 * consistent with the airport references already in the course prose — e.g.
 * data/golf-courses/bangkok/suvarnabhumi-golf-country-club.ts places that
 * course "east of Suvarnabhumi Airport", and it sits at 13.816, 100.865,
 * north-east of the BKK terminal below.
 *
 * `guideHref` links to the matching arrival-transfer guide in
 * data/explainer-pages.ts (both slugs are published English guides).
